## Reflection Document

### HTML

01.
    I learned a lot about the foundations of html, these are basically the building blocks of web design.
02.
    Forms are really fun to use! This system of "find the problem" is interesting and fun but also without a reference of everything that was wrong in the end, makes it not as useful. 
03.
    CSS is such a good system to remove bloat in html. It was cool to try a bunch of ways to adjust a site for different needs or styles and a great opener to how an actual site is made. 
04.
    Flexboxes were great to learn, but also a pain to work with. The way they get positioned was not my favorite technique by any means, it felt clunky mentally.
05.
    A BLESSING, GRIDS ARE SO MUCH BETTER, ITS SO INTUITIVE.
06.
    Bootstrap has some very fun usages that make a page dynamic, honestly one of the most interesting labs and potentially one of the most useful. 
07.
    THE most imporant one of the bunch. So helpful, and so imporant to know. The basis of modern web design. 
### Accessibility

01.
    I had no idea that I couldn't nest lists unless it's within a list item.
02.
    The style of the page was simple so there wasn't much to say, other than simple is easy to read. 
03.
    This to me is where the majority of accessibility is worked on. Visual design is so important for people with glasses or colorblindness so it's cool to know we can adjust element sizes based on screen size for older folk.
04.
    Flexbox was very helpful for placement of objects, but beyond that I dont see much about accessibility other than color coordination. 
05.
    Basically the same as flexbox, just easier to work with.
06.
    This one is more of learning HOW to make it accessible, a lot of these dont seem to be helpful for people who need ease of use. 
07.
    An amazing resource to make a page more accessible, it allows for page customization for users to fix a site to their needs.
